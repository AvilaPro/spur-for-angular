Theme source â€” https://github.com/HackerThemes/spur-template

## Introduction
Yesterday I found this nice admin theme built by @[hackerthemes](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-tools/) and I thought that I was be a nice idea to get it for Angular 8, so I converted it and give you the opportunity to simply use it as per your needs, if you'd like to contribute feel free to clone/fork and send your Pull Requests.
